# Day Planner

## Description

A simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day.

# Functionality

The app displays standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.). Each time slot represents one hour and contains the following:

* The time

* A field to hold user input

* A save button

Clicking on the save button will store the time and user input in `localStorage`.

Near the top of the calendar, the application displays the current day. Additionally, each hour is color coded to reflect whether the time slot is in the past, the present, or the future. This changes depending on the time of day.

# Installation

No intallation needed. Most browsers will support this project.
